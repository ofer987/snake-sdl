# Blockedly Blocked-Block Snake

Implemented using [SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3) for macOS.

## Build Instructions

1. Install [SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3) into `/Library/Frameworks`.
2. Use Xcode (I have only tested using Xcode 16.2) to build and/or archive to distribute.

Seeing as this project is still a Work-in-Progress, you should build and run it using Xcode (personally, I have only tested on Xcode 16.2).

### WARNING

This is a Work-in-Progress! There might be bugs; but you could identify them by opening Issues in GitHub or fixing them with Pull Requests.

## How to Play

Use the Vim keys **H, J, K, and L** to move around (or the arrow keys).

**P** to Pause.
**R** to Restart.
**Q** to Quit.
